# String streams
Write a program that asks user to enter a line that contains integers or “stop” to stop the program. If
user enters a string that starts with “stop” the program stops. Otherwise, the program creates a
string stream from the user input and reads integers from the stream. Program keeps reading and
summing integer until the stream ends or reading an integer fails because text or other non-
numerical character is encountered. When the reading stops the sum and count are printed and
program asks user to enter another string.<br>
For example:
```
Enter a line with numbers or “stop”: 1 6 34 78 4 6
Total of 6 numbers is 129
Enter a line with numbers or “stop”: 4 99 zip 44 6
Total of 2 numbers is 103
Enter a line with numbers or “stop”: stop
```
